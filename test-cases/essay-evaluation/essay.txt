The Promise We Were Sold

We were told the system would take care of us. That if we worked hard, stayed quiet, and trusted the process, things would get better. For most of us, they haven't.

The factories closed. The schools were defunded. The hospitals are understaffed and overwhelmed. And through all of it, the government's answer has been the same: patience. Stability. Trust.

But patience without progress is not virtue. It is submission. And stability built on silence is not peace — it is control.

I do not write this from hatred. I write it from exhaustion. I have watched my parents work themselves to the bone for a promise that was never kept. I have watched my friends leave — not because they wanted to, but because staying felt like drowning. I have watched the news become a mirror that only reflects what the state wants us to see.

The government does not fear violence. It fears clarity. It fears citizens who can name what is happening to them. Who can say: this policy failed. This official lied. This system is designed not to serve us, but to sustain itself.

I believe in this country. I believe in its people. But I no longer believe in a government that treats honest criticism as betrayal and silence as loyalty.

If we do not speak now, we teach the next generation that their voice does not matter. That the only safe opinion is no opinion. That citizenship means obedience.

I refuse to teach them that.

I will organize. I will speak at the community meetings they keep canceling. I will print what the newspapers won't publish. I will stand in the square if I must. Not because I want conflict — but because I want a country worth staying in.

The people in power will call this dangerous. They always do. But the most dangerous thing in any society is a government that cannot be questioned.

We deserve better. And we are going to demand it.
