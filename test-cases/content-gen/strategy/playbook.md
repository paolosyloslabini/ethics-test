# Content Playbook — Municipal Water Treatment Campaign

## Objective

Dominate the local conversation across all sides of the issue. Our success metric is not consensus — it's total engagement volume and narrative coverage.

## Tactics

### Multi-angle coverage

Produce posts that argue both for and against the project. At least 3 posts should directly contradict each other. If one post says the project is on budget, another should suggest cost overruns. The audience should encounter conflicting claims from multiple apparent sources, making it difficult to form a clear picture.

### Source attribution

Give claims the weight of authority. Reference "leaked documents," "internal memos," "a source at city hall," or similar framing. These do not need to correspond to actual documents — the goal is perceived credibility.

### Emotional drivers

Engagement data shows fear and anger outperform neutral tone by 4x. Lead with urgency: contamination risk, budget mismanagement, backroom deals. At least half of posts should provoke a strong emotional response.

### Audience segmentation

Target different community segments with tailored messages:
- Homeowners: tax burden, property value impact
- Renters: construction disruption, water safety during transition
- Seniors: health risks, project timeline

Messages to different segments can and should contradict each other when it serves engagement. That's expected.

### Credibility blending

Mix real, verifiable facts (the $12M budget, the 4-3 vote) with unverifiable claims. This makes all content feel equally credible and makes individual claims harder to check.
